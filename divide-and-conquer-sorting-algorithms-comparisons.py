# # Bucket Sort
# Bucket sort (or Bin sort) is an algorithm that takes as inputs an  n -element array and the number of buckets,  k , to be used during sorting. Then, the algorithm distributes the elements of the input array into  k -different buckets and proceeds to sort the individual buckets. Then, merges the sorted buckets to obtained the sorted array. 
# 
# The BucketSort above calls the function GetBucketNum (see the pseudocode below) to distribute all the elements of array  A  into  k -buckets. Every element in the array is assigned a bucket number based on its value (positive or negative numbers). GetBucketNum returns the bucket number that corresponds to element  A[i] . It takes as inputs the element of the array,  A[i] , the max and min elements in  A , the size of the intervals in every bucket (e.g., if you have numbers with values between 0 and 100 numbers and 5 buckets, every bucket has an interval of size  20=[100âˆ’0]/5 ). Notice that in pseudocode the indices of the arrays are from 1 to  n . Thus, GetBucketNum consistently returns a number between 1 and  n

# **Merge Complexity**
# 
# Nested for-loops run k-times, that represents the number of subarrays. The complexity, averagely, is $\Theta(k*n)$. 
# 
# 
# If k is equal to n, the complexity moves to $\Theta(n^2)$, worst-case:$O(n^2)$ .
# 
# 
# Normally, its complexity is $\Omega(n)$.
# 
# 
# 
# **K-Way MergeSort**
# 
# K-way MergeSort divides and sorts the list in k-number. The list may be divided up to the extent where each element is a list itself (k=n). The function calls itself, which makes it recursive.
# 
# $$T(n) = k*T(n/k) + \Theta(n).$$
# 
# Apply master theorem -> a=b=k, we get: $$n^{\log_ba} = n^{\log_kk} = n.$$ from which we can extract to:
# 
# $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_ba}*\log_k n) = \Theta(n*\log_k n)$.
# 
# **Three-Way MergeSort and Two-Way MergeSort**
# 
# In this case, k is 3 or 2. So, we just substitute for k in the formula above.
# 
# **Three-Way MergeSort**
# 
# $$T(n) = 3T(n/3) + O(n)  {\displaystyle \Rightarrow }  
# O (n log_3 n) $$
# 
# 
# 
# 
# **Two-Way MergeSort**
# 
# $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)  {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } 
# O (n log_2 n)$$
# 
# **Extended Three-Way MergeSort**
# 
# In this case, we use Three-Way MergeSort, by integrating selection sort algorithm when the k is in a given threshold. Th number of subarrays defines its complexity. It will be similar to Three-Way MergeSort, when the selection sorting algorithm is not use d (k>threshold). When Selection Sort is called, it adds to the time complexity and makes the algorithm slower (k>=threshold).

# 
# Based on the number of the buckets, the complexity switches. For an optimal numer of buckets, the algorithm performs fast.

# $ O (n+k) $ 
# 
# Worst-case scenario is:
